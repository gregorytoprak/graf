# Graph Maker

[graph.gdt.io](http://graph.gdt.io/)

Draw mathematical graphs with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface!

- Create nodes, and edges between them
- Choose colors and for edges to have arrows
- Move nodes and curve edges intuitively
- Manipulate the sheet as a whole by panning and zooming like a map app
- Save your completed graph drawing to SVG with the click of a button

### TODO

- some way of choosing how many rays an axis has --- on creation?
